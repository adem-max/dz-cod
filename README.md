# dz_cod — COD e-commerce starter kit on ERPNext (Algeria)

A Frappe app, installed next to ERPNext, that turns ERPNext into a
cash-on-delivery order desk for Algerian online sellers (Instagram, Facebook,
website): phone confirmation, stock reservation, shipping fees by wilaya,
courier hand-over, returns, and courier cash settlement ("Versement").

## Status

| | |
|---|---|
| **Target version** | **ERPNext v16.50.0 on Frappe v16.51.0** (branch `version-16`, latest stable major in October 2026) |
| **Tested on a real site?** | **Yes.** Installed and run in an Ubuntu 24.04 container: Python 3.14, Node 24, MariaDB 10.11, Redis. |
| **Automated tests** | 45 tests (17 unit + 28 integration on a real ERPNext site), all passing, on the development site and on a brand-new site. |
| **Checked in a real browser** | order list and form, "Expédier" dialog, return inspection dialog, reports, COD sidebar (headless Chromium). |
| **Demo** | loaded on a fresh site in 2 min 20 s; second run changes nothing; wipe + reload checked. |
| **Backup / restore** | backup of the demo site restored into a new site, data and encrypted secrets verified. |
| **Not run** | production mode (nginx, supervisor, Let's Encrypt, firewall), off-site copy to a real cloud storage (the backup script was run with a local rclone remote), the Fedora/distrobox commands — they need a public server or a Fedora machine. Marked *(not run here)* in the docs. |
| **Not implemented** | real courier API connector: `couriers/yalidine.py` is a documented stub (`# UNTESTED`, raises "not implemented"). The Yalidine and ZR Express APIs have since been researched; the implementation plan is in docs/COURIER_INTEGRATION.md. |

## What you get

**Order life cycle** — a standard ERPNext Workflow on Sales Order ("Commande"):

```
Nouvelle ──Confirmer──> Confirmée ──Préparer──> Préparée ──Expédier──> Expédiée ──Marquer livrée──> Livrée ──Marquer réglée──> Réglée
   │ ▲                     │                       │                     │
   │ └─Pas de réponse─> Injoignable (call counter) │                     └──Marquer retournée──> Retournée
   └─Annuler─> Annulée     └────────Annuler────────┴──> Annulée après confirmation
```

- **Confirmée**: phone, wilaya and address checked; stock reserved (ERPNext reserved qty); optional block if stock is short.
- **Injoignable**: each "Pas de réponse" adds 1 to the call counter; the button disappears at the maximum (default 3).
- **Expédiée**: courier + tracking number (typed, or given by the courier connector); a Delivery Note takes the stock out.
- **Retournée**: a return Delivery Note brings the parcel into the **Retours** warehouse; then **Inspecter le retour** puts good pieces back in stock and writes damaged ones off.
- **Réglée**: set by a courier settlement (Versement).

**Shipping fees** — the list of the **69 wilayas** (2026 division) holds a
home-delivery and a stop-desk rate plus the courier's cost; the fee is added
to each order automatically (editable "manual rate" for free delivery).

**Versement (courier settlement)** — record a courier's statement, match each
parcel to its order (by tracking number), see what is **paid**, **disputed**
and **missing**; submitting marks paid orders "Réglée".

**Courier connectors** — one interface (create shipment, get status, get
tracking); **Manuel** (default), **Mock** (offline, for tests and demos),
**Yalidine** (stub). Optional hourly status sync.

**Webhooks for n8n** — on Confirmée, Expédiée, Livrée, Retournée, with a
documented JSON payload (docs/WEBHOOKS.md). Created disabled.

**Reports** — *Commandes par jour (COD)*, *Taux de retour (COD)* (by
product, variant or wilaya), *Encours transporteurs (COD)*.

**Demo shop** — "Encre & Fil SARL", a fictional seller: 30 products / ~260
variants, 80 customers, 200 orders over 60 days in every state, weekly
settlements (docs/DEMO.md).

## Install

On a bench with Frappe v16 and ERPNext v16 (full server guide: docs/DEPLOY.md):

```bash
cd ~/frappe-bench
bench get-app https://github.com/adem-max/dz-cod        # downloads the app (folder apps/dz_cod)
bench --site erp.client1.com install-app dz_cod          # custom fields, workflow, 69 wilayas, webhooks
```

Then, in the site (interface in French):

1. **Paramètres COD**: company, main warehouse, returns warehouse, account for delivery fees.
2. **Fournisseur** for each courier with *Est un transporteur* ticked (connector "Manuel").
3. **Wilayas et tarifs**: replace the example rates with the courier's rate card.
4. Optionally enable the **Webhooks** (docs/WEBHOOKS.md).

Updates: `bench update`, or for this app only `git pull` in `apps/dz_cod`
then `bench --site all migrate` (docs/DEPLOY.md §11).

## Try it on your laptop

docs/LOCAL_TEST.md (Fedora, using an Ubuntu 24.04 distrobox), then docs/DEMO.md.

## Run the tests

```bash
bench --site test.localhost set-config allow_tests 1      # on a test site, never in production
bench --site test.localhost run-tests --app dz_cod
```

## Rules this code follows

1. ERPNext / Frappe core is never modified: everything is in this app.
2. Standard doctypes first (Sales Order, Delivery Note, Stock Entry, Customer, Supplier, Item); new doctypes only where nothing fits (justified in DECISIONS.md).
3. Per-client differences live in settings and data, never in code branches.
4. Short, plainly commented code, English in code, French for users.
5. Currency DZD, no VAT logic.
