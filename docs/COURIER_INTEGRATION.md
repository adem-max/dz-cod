# Courier integration: Yalidine and ZR Express

What is known about the couriers' APIs and prices (October 2026), how sure
we are, and the step-by-step plan to replace the stub in
`dz_cod/couriers/yalidine.py` with real connectors.

Nothing in this file has been called against a real courier account yet.
Every step ends with a check you do with the client's real account.

---

## 1. What was found, and how much to trust it

| Source | What it gives | Trust |
|--------|---------------|-------|
| **Yalidine official docs** (in the merchant dashboard, login required; not reachable from the build machine) | everything | the authority: always check against it |
| **Copy of Yalidine's official API + webhook docs** saved in the open-source project [TaharBn12/Ecommerce-sys](https://github.com/TaharBn12/Ecommerce-sys) (`.agents/skills/yalidine-integration-skill-main/offcial-docs.md` and `webook.md`, updated September 2026) | endpoints, fields, statuses, fees, rate limits, webhooks | **high**: a verbatim copy of Yalidine's documentation |
| [ZaouiAmine/dzcouriers](https://github.com/ZaouiAmine/dzcouriers) (Go client, Sept 2026) and [PiteurStudio/CourierDZ](https://github.com/PiteurStudio/CourierDZ) (PHP) | working client code for Yalidine, ZR Express (new and legacy), Ecotrack, Maystro, NOEST | medium: unofficial, but they agree with each other and with the Yalidine docs copy |
| ZR Express official docs ("API Docs" in the ZR merchant app, per [zrexpress.net](https://www.zrexpress.net/en)) | ZR endpoints | not reachable from here: **ask ZR for them** |
| Price comparison sites ([dz-ecom.com](https://dz-ecom.com/en/blog/yalidine-vs-zr-express-vs-noest-comparatif-2026), [dropdz.space](https://dropdz.space/livraison-algerie), [codrocket.com](https://codrocket.com/fr/blog/best-delivery-companies-algeria-2026)) | indicative 2026 price ranges | low: they contradict each other |

## 2. Prices: why there is no public price list

**Neither Yalidine nor ZR Express publishes an official national price
list.** Prices depend on the merchant account:

- **Yalidine**: the price depends on the **departure wilaya** (where the shop
  hands the parcels over), the **destination commune** (not only the wilaya),
  the delivery type, and the **weight** (above 5 kg). Yalidine exposes the
  account's own prices through its API (`GET /v1/fees/`), so **we can import
  them automatically** (step Y5 below).
- **ZR Express**: the price list is negotiated per merchant (ZR advertises
  "preferential rates from 50 parcels/month"). No price endpoint was found
  in the open-source clients. **Type the client's ZR rate card into the
  wilaya list** (*Wilayas et tarifs*).

Indicative 2026 ranges from comparison sites (≤ 5 kg, not official):

| | Home delivery | Stop desk |
|---|---|---|
| Yalidine, north | ~400–600 DA | ~250–450 DA |
| Yalidine, south / far south | ~900–1,400 DA | ~600–1,100 DA |
| ZR Express, north | ~350–700 DA | ~200–450 DA |

Our example rates (400 → 1,400 DA by zone) sit in that range, but only the
client's account gives the real numbers.

**Other costs from the Yalidine fees API** (per account): `retour_fee`
(charged when a parcel comes back, e.g. 250 DA), `cod_percentage` (e.g. 0.75 %
of the collected amount), `insurance_percentage`, and `oversize_fee` per kg
above 5 kg. Today the kit only models one courier cost per wilaya; the return
fee and COD percentage are a planned improvement (step Y5, last point).

## 3. Yalidine: what the API looks like

Facts from the docs copy. Check each against the client's dashboard docs.

- **Base URL**: `https://api.yalidine.app/v1/`
- **Authentication**: two HTTP headers on every call, `X-API-ID` and
  `X-API-TOKEN`, from the Yalidine *Developer Dashboard* of the client's account.
- **Rate limits** (defaults): 5 calls/second, 50/minute, 1,000/hour,
  10,000/day. Remaining quota comes back in headers `x-second-quota-left`,
  `x-minute-quota-left`, `x-hour-quota-left`, `x-day-quota-left`. Over the
  limit: HTTP 429 with a `Retry-After` header. Repeated abuse temporarily
  disables the API key, so stay well under the limits.
- **Endpoints**:

| Need | Call |
|------|------|
| create parcels | `POST /v1/parcels/` with a JSON **list** of parcels |
| read parcel(s) | `GET /v1/parcels/<tracking>` or `GET /v1/parcels/?tracking=a,b,c` |
| edit / delete | `PATCH` / `DELETE /v1/parcels/<tracking>` (only while status is "En préparation") |
| status history | `GET /v1/histories/<tracking>` or `GET /v1/histories/?tracking=a,b,c` |
| stop desks | `GET /v1/centers/?wilaya_id=16` (gives `center_id`) |
| communes | `GET /v1/communes/?wilaya_id=16` (with `has_stop_desk`, `is_deliverable`) |
| wilayas | `GET /v1/wilayas/` |
| prices | `GET /v1/fees/?from_wilaya_id=<departure>&to_wilaya_id=<destination>` |

- **Create parcel, required fields**: `order_id` (we send the Sales Order
  name), `from_wilaya_name`, `firstname`, `familyname`, `contact_phone`
  (starts with 0; several numbers separated by commas), `address`,
  `to_commune_name`, `to_wilaya_name`, `product_list` (text), `price` (amount
  to collect, 0–150,000), `do_insurance`, `declared_value`, `length`, `width`,
  `height`, `weight`, `freeshipping`, `is_stopdesk`, `stopdesk_id` (required
  when `is_stopdesk` is true), `has_exchange` (+ `product_to_collect` if true).
- **Create parcel, answer**: one entry per `order_id`:
  `{"SAL-ORD-2026-00012": {"success": true, "tracking": "yal-12345A", "label": "https://…", "message": ""}}`.
  Valid parcels are created even if others in the same call fail.
- **Statuses** (French text): Pas encore expédié, A vérifier, En préparation,
  Pas encore ramassé, Prêt à expédier, En passation, Ramassé, Bloqué,
  Débloqué, Transfert, Expédié, Centre, En localisation, Vers Wilaya, En
  transit, Reçu à Wilaya, En attente du client, Prêt pour livreur, Sorti en
  livraison, En attente, Annulé, En alerte, Alerte résolue, Tentative échouée,
  **Livré**, Echèc livraison, Retour vers centre, Retourné au centre, Retour
  transfert, Retour groupé, Retour à retirer, Retour non retiré, Colis
  abandonné, Retour vers vendeur, **Retourné au vendeur**, Echange échoué.
- **Payment status of each parcel**: `not-ready`, `ready`, `receivable`,
  `payed`, with a `payment_id` (the payout manifest) — useful to pre-fill
  our Versement.
- **Webhooks** (push instead of polling): events `parcel_created`,
  `parcel_edited`, `parcel_deleted`, `parcel_status_updated`,
  `parcel_payment_updated`. Each delivery groups several events, each with an
  `event_id` (to ignore duplicates) and `occurred_at` (order is not
  guaranteed). Yalidine first sends a **GET** with `subscribe` and
  `crc_token`: the endpoint must answer the `crc_token` value as plain text
  within 10 s, and Yalidine re-checks this from time to time (fail = webhook
  disabled). Each delivery carries an `X-YALIDINE-SIGNATURE` header =
  HMAC-SHA256 of the raw body with the webhook's secret key. Failed
  deliveries are retried 7 times with growing delays, then the webhook is
  disabled.
- **Wilaya codes**: Yalidine works with wilaya **names** in parcels and
  numeric ids in filters. Check in `GET /v1/wilayas/` whether the 2026
  wilayas (59–69) exist in Yalidine; if not, send the **parent wilaya**
  (field *Wilaya d'origine* on our wilaya records, already filled).

## 4. Yalidine: implementation steps

Estimated effort: 3–4 days including tests. Do it on your laptop with the
client's API keys, against **one or two real test parcels** that you delete
right after (deleting is allowed while status is "En préparation").

**Y1. Configuration fields** (`setup/custom_fields.py`, then migrate)
- On **Supplier** (the courier): `dz_from_wilaya` (Link DZ Wilaya, the
  shop's departure wilaya) and `dz_webhook_secret` (Password). `dz_api_id`
  and `dz_api_token` already exist.
- On **Sales Order**: `dz_stopdesk_id` (Data, "Bureau stop desk"), needed
  when the delivery type is Stop desk; `dz_label_url` (Data, read-only,
  allow on submit) to print the courier's label.

**Y2. A small HTTP helper** in `couriers/yalidine.py`

```python
BASE_URL = "https://api.yalidine.app/v1/"

def call(self, method, path, params=None, json=None):
    headers = {"X-API-ID": self.courier.dz_api_id,
               "X-API-TOKEN": self.courier.get_password("dz_api_token")}
    response = requests.request(method, BASE_URL + path, headers=headers,
                                params=params, json=json, timeout=20)
    if response.status_code == 429:
        frappe.throw(_("Yalidine : quota dépassé, réessayez dans {0} s.").format(response.headers.get("Retry-After")))
    response.raise_for_status()
    return response.json()
```

Check: `call("GET", "wilayas/", params={"page_size": 1})` in the console
returns data with the client's keys.

**Y3. `create_shipment(order)`**
- Build one parcel dict from the order: `order_id` = order name;
  `from_wilaya_name` = name of the courier's `dz_from_wilaya`;
  `to_wilaya_name` = wilaya name (or its parent wilaya for 59–69 if Yalidine
  does not know it); `to_commune_name` = `dz_commune` (must match Yalidine's
  spelling: see Y6); `firstname` / `familyname` = split customer name
  (repeat the first name if there is only one word); `contact_phone` =
  `dz_phone` (plus `,dz_phone_2`); `address`; `product_list` = "2 x T-shirt
  Casbah Noir M, …"; `price` = `dz_cod_amount`; `declared_value` = same;
  `do_insurance` = false; `weight` = 1 (or a weight from the items);
  `length/width/height` = 1; `freeshipping` = false (the customer pays,
  already inside `price`); `is_stopdesk` = delivery type is Stop desk;
  `stopdesk_id` = `dz_stopdesk_id`; `has_exchange` = false.
- `POST parcels/` with `[parcel]`; read the entry for our `order_id`; if
  `success` is false, `frappe.throw` the `message` (the order then stays
  Préparée and nothing moves in stock).
- Return the `tracking`; save `label` into `dz_label_url`.
- Check: ship one test order; the parcel appears in the Yalidine dashboard
  with the same amount; delete it there.

Note: the API call happens inside the database transaction of the
"Expédier" click. If something fails *after* the call (very rare), the
parcel exists at Yalidine but our order stays Préparée. Clicking again
would create a second parcel, so first look the parcel up with
`GET parcels/?order_id=…` (check that filter exists in the docs) or show a
clear message to delete the orphan parcel in the dashboard.

**Y4. `get_status(tracking)` and `get_tracking(tracking)`**
- `GET histories/<tracking>`, take the latest `date_status`.
- Translate to our four words. Proposal (decide with the client):

| Yalidine status | Ours |
|-----------------|------|
| Livré | `delivered` |
| Retourné au vendeur | `returned` (the parcel is physically back: the return note goes into the Retours warehouse) |
| everything else | `in_transit` |

  "Echèc livraison", "Retour vers vendeur", "Retour à retirer" mean the
  parcel is *coming back*; show them on the order (a new read-only field
  `dz_courier_status`) so the team knows, but only move to Retournée when it
  has arrived.
- For the hourly sync, ask for 50 tracking numbers per call
  (`histories/?tracking=a,b,…`) instead of one call per order, to stay far
  below the rate limits.
- Check: with the test parcel, `get_tracking` lists its history.

**Y5. Import prices into the wilaya list**
- A button on the courier (Supplier) form, "Importer les tarifs Yalidine":
  for each of the 58 Yalidine wilayas call
  `fees/?from_wilaya_id=<dz_from_wilaya>&to_wilaya_id=<n>`, wait 1.5 s
  between calls (50/minute limit), and write the price of the wilaya's
  chef-lieu commune into *Coût transporteur domicile / stop desk*
  (`express_home`, `express_desk`). Leave the customer prices (*Tarif
  domicile / stop desk*) to the seller: they decide whether to add a margin.
- Later, for exact prices per commune: a "commune" master list (LATER.md
  item 4) with Yalidine's per-commune prices, and add `retour_fee` and
  `cod_percentage` to the settlement's expected fee.
- Check: compare 3 wilayas with the prices shown in the client's dashboard.

**Y6. Communes and stop desks**
- Yalidine refuses commune names it does not know. Add a small "Communes
  Yalidine" import (`communes/?wilaya_id=…`) and use it in the order form
  as a dropdown filtered by wilaya, instead of free text, for clients who
  use Yalidine.
- Same for stop desks: import `centers/` and let the operator pick the
  office when the delivery type is Stop desk (fills `dz_stopdesk_id`).

**Y7. Webhook receiver (optional, replaces polling)**
- A guest endpoint `dz_cod.couriers.yalidine_webhook.receive`
  (`@frappe.whitelist(allow_guest=True, methods=["GET", "POST"])`):
  - GET with `subscribe` and `crc_token`: return the token as plain text
    (`return werkzeug.wrappers.Response(crc_token)`; Frappe passes a returned
    Response straight through, checked in v16's `handler.py`).
  - POST: compute `hmac.new(secret, raw_body, hashlib.sha256).hexdigest()`,
    compare with `X-YALIDINE-SIGNATURE` using `hmac.compare_digest`; reject
    if different. Read `frappe.request.get_data()` **before** parsing JSON.
  - For each event: skip it if its `event_id` was already processed (store
    ids in a small log doctype), then for `parcel_status_updated` apply the
    same mapping as Y4 with `apply_workflow`; for `parcel_payment_updated`
    store `status`/`payment_id` on the order.
  - Answer 200 quickly; do the work in `frappe.enqueue` if it is slow.
- In the Yalidine Webhooks dashboard: URL
  `https://erp.client.com/api/method/dz_cod.couriers.yalidine_webhook.receive`,
  test it with Yalidine's test page, then set it to active.
- Keep the hourly sync as a safety net (webhooks can be disabled after 7
  failed deliveries).

**Y8. Versement from Yalidine payments (optional)**
- A button "Charger depuis Yalidine": read parcels with
  `payment_status=receivable` or a given `payment_id`, and create one line per
  parcel (tracking, amount, fee). The matching rules stay the same.

**Y9. Tests**
- Unit tests with a fake HTTP layer (`unittest.mock.patch("requests.request")`)
  returning the JSON examples from the docs: create success, create failure
  message, history → status mapping, 429 handling, webhook signature
  accepted / rejected, `crc_token` echo.
- One manual end-to-end test with the client's account before going live.

## 5. ZR Express: what the API looks like

ZR Express has **two APIs**. Ask the client which one their account uses.

**New platform** (`https://api.zrexpress.app/api/v1/`, read from two
independent open-source clients; ask ZR for the official "API Docs"):
- **Authentication**: headers `X-Api-Key` (secret key) and `X-Tenant`
  (tenant id, a UUID), both from the ZR merchant portal (API / integrations).
- **Places are UUIDs, not names**: wilayas ("city") and communes
  ("district") are *territories* found with
  `POST territories/search` `{"keyword": "Alger", "pageSize": 50, "pageNumber": 1}`
  (add `"deliveryType": {"value": "pickup-point"}` to find stop desks).
- **Creating a parcel takes 4 calls**: create the customer
  (`POST customers/individual` → customer id), find the city and district
  UUIDs, `POST parcels` (→ parcel id), then `GET parcels/<id>` to read the
  `trackingNumber`. Phones are sent in international format (`+213…`).
- **Tracking**: `GET parcels/<tracking>/state-history`.
- **Labels**: `POST parcels/labels/individual/pdf`.
- **Cancel**: `POST parcels/bulk/by-tracking-number`.
- **Webhooks**: registered through the API (`webhooks/endpoints`), with a
  signing secret.
- **State names are free text configured per merchant account** (for
  example "Out for Delivery", "In Transit", "At Hub"): there is no fixed
  list. You must look at the real names in the client's account and map them.
- **Prices**: no price endpoint found; use the negotiated rate card.

**Old platform "Procolis"** (`https://procolis.com/api_v1/`): credentials
*Token* + *Key* (ZR portal → Paramètres → Info personnelles). Older accounts
may still use it. Do not build both: build the one the client has.

## 6. ZR Express (new platform): implementation steps

Estimated effort: 3–5 days, more uncertain than Yalidine because the
official docs must first be obtained.

**Z0. Get the official documentation** from ZR (merchant app → API Docs, or
the client's account manager). Compare it with section 5 and correct this
plan where it differs. Do not start coding before this.

**Z1. Configuration fields**: on Supplier, `dz_api_id` holds the tenant id
and `dz_api_token` the secret key (rename the labels for ZR, or add
`dz_tenant_id`); add a child table **"Correspondance des statuts"** (ZR state
name → our word: delivered / returned / in_transit). This mapping is per
client because ZR state names are per account (rule 4: settings, not code).

**Z2. Territory cache**: a doctype or a cached dict "ZR territory" (wilaya
code / commune name → UUID), filled once with `territories/search` and
refreshed monthly. Avoids 2 extra calls per parcel.

**Z3. `create_shipment(order)`**: customer → (cached) territories →
`POST parcels` with `externalId` = order name, `amount` = `dz_cod_amount`,
`deliveryType` = `home` or `pickup-point` (+ `hubId` for stop desk),
`orderedProducts` from the order lines → `GET parcels/<id>` for the tracking
number. If the tracking number is not ready yet, store the parcel id and let
the sync fill the tracking number later.

**Z4. `get_status` / `get_tracking`**: `state-history`, last entry, mapped
through the table from Z1; unknown state names → `in_transit` + an Error Log
entry "ZR state not mapped: …" so you add it to the table.

**Z5. Webhook receiver** (like Y7) once the official docs describe the
payload and signature; until then, hourly polling.

**Z6. Tests**: same approach as Y9, with JSON captured from the client's
real account.

## 7. Common work for any courier

1. Add the new class to `ADAPTERS` in `dz_cod/couriers/__init__.py` and the
   option name to the Supplier field *Connecteur* (`setup/custom_fields.py`).
2. Never put keys in code: they live in the Supplier record (*API Token* is
   encrypted). Back up the site's `encryption_key` (docs/DEPLOY.md §9).
3. Turn on *Synchroniser les statuts automatiquement* in COD Settings only
   after the status mapping has been checked on real parcels.
4. Add a print format with the courier label link / barcode (LATER.md).
5. Update DECISIONS.md and the study guide chapter 6 with what you built.
