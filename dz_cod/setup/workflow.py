"""Create (or update) the "Commande COD" Workflow on Sales Order.

Think of the workflow as a routing in manufacturing:
- each STATE is an operation the order sits at (Nouvelle, Confirmée, ...)
- each TRANSITION is the move from one operation to the next, with a button
  name (the action) and the role allowed to press it.

This file only DESCRIBES the workflow. What happens on each move (create the
delivery note, return stock, ...) is coded in dz_cod/cod/order.py.
