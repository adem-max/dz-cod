"""The base interface every courier connector ("adapter") must follow.

Why an adapter? Each delivery company has its own API. The rest of the app
should not care which one is used: it only calls the three methods below.
To add a new courier, write one new class with these three methods and add it
to ADAPTERS in dz_cod/couriers/__init__.py. Nothing else changes.

Statuses returned by get_status() always use OUR small vocabulary below, not
the courier's own words. Translating the courier's words into ours is the
adapter's job.
