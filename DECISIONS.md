# Decisions

Every choice made while building this kit, with one line of reasoning.
Newest decisions are added at the bottom of each section.

## Platform

- **ERPNext v16 (16.50.0) on Frappe v16 (16.51.0)**: v16 is the latest stable major (branch `version-16`, October 2026). `develop` is the future v17 and is not stable.
- **Python 3.14, Node 24, MariaDB 10.11, Redis 7**: Frappe v16 requires Python 3.14 and Node ≥ 24 and supports MariaDB 10.6 to 11.8. Ubuntu 24.04 ships MariaDB 10.11.
- **Ubuntu 24.04 LTS for the server guide**: that is what everything was tested on. Ubuntu 26.04 LTS should work but was not tested.
- **The GitHub repo is the Frappe app itself** (the `dz_cod` package sits at the root): `bench get-app https://github.com/adem-max/dz-cod` works directly.
- **No core changes, everything in `dz_cod`**: project rule. We use hooks, custom fields, a Workflow, Webhooks and three small doctypes.

## Reference data

- **69 wilayas, not 58**: law 26-06 of 4 April 2026 (JO n° 25) created 11 wilayas, and decree 26-206 (JO n° 40) set their numbers 59 to 69. I could not open the Journal officiel itself; numbers and names come from several Algerian press articles quoting the decree. **Double-check them.**
- **Each new wilaya remembers its parent wilaya**: couriers may keep the 58-wilaya codes for a while (the transfer runs until 31 December 2026).
- **Parent wilayas of 59–69 come from press reports**, not from the law text. **Double-check them.**
- **Communes are free text**, not a master list: the 1,541 communes would need a verified source; listed in LATER.md.
- **Example shipping rates in 6 zones (400 DA Alger home delivery … 1,400 DA far south)**: placeholders. Replace them with each client's courier rate card.
- **Default courier cost = customer rate**: most small sellers pass the courier price straight to the customer; edit per wilaya if not.
- **Phone rule**: mobile = 05/06/07 + 8 digits, landline = 9 digits; `+213` and `00213` are converted to `0`. Unknown formats are kept as typed, never destroyed.

## New doctypes (rule 3: only when a standard one does not fit)

- **DZ Wilaya** (label "Wilaya"): ERPNext has no list of Algerian provinces with rates. `Territory` was considered but it is ERPNext's sales-hierarchy tree; mixing addresses and courier rates into it would confuse sales targets and pricing rules.
- **COD Settings** (label "Paramètres COD", single record): rule 4 — per-client differences must live in settings, not code.
- **Courier Settlement + Courier Settlement Item** (label "Versement"): nothing standard matches "a third party's statement matched line by line against our orders". Payment Entry is per party (one customer) and full accounting is out of scope; Bank Reconciliation works on bank lines, not parcels.

## Order life cycle

- **The life cycle is a standard Frappe Workflow on Sales Order** ("Commande COD"): it gives buttons, roles, history comments and list colours for free.
- **Confirmer = submit the Sales Order**: before confirmation the operator must be able to edit everything (size, address) during the phone call; after it, stock is reserved and the order is locked.
- **Two cancel states**: "Annulée" (draft, customer said no on the phone) and "Annulée après confirmation" (submitted then cancelled). Frappe cannot cancel a draft, so one state cannot cover both.
- **Stock reservation = ERPNext's standard "reserved qty"** (soft reservation, automatic on submit), not Stock Reservation Entries (hard reservation): simpler and enough for a small shop. Hard reservation is in LATER.md.
- **Stock check at confirmation warns by default and can block** (setting): a print-on-demand seller confirms before printing.
- **Expédier creates and submits the Delivery Note immediately**: stock leaves the main warehouse when the parcel leaves. Courier and tracking number are copied to the standard "Transporter" and "Transport Receipt No" fields.
- **Retournée creates a return Delivery Note into the "Retours" warehouse** and then closes the Sales Order, so ERPNext never reserves that stock again.
- **Inspection uses standard Stock Entries**: Material Transfer (Retours → main) for good pieces, Material Issue for damaged ones, linked back to the order with a custom field.
- **No Sales Invoice and no Payment Entry**: full accounting is out of scope. Consequence: sales revenue is not in the general ledger and delivered orders show ERPNext status "To Bill". Listed first in LATER.md.
- **Delivery details are stored on the order** (phone, wilaya, commune, address), copied from the customer when empty: the courier needs a snapshot per order, and COD order entry must be fast. ERPNext's Address and Contact doctypes are not used for COD.
- **Unanswered calls are counted by the Workflow itself** (the "update field" option of the "Injoignable" state), with no code. The "Pas de réponse" button disappears at the maximum set in COD Settings (default 3).
- **Standard roles only**: Sales User confirms, Stock User prepares/ships/delivers/returns, Accounts User settles, Sales Manager may edit cancelled orders. "Allow self approval" is on because the shops are tiny teams.
- **The "Expédier" button opens a small dialog** (courier + tracking number) before the workflow action, because the tracking number must be saved before the move.
- **Event dates can be forced through `order.flags.dz_event_date`**: only the demo loader uses it, to replay 60 days of history with correct past dates.

## Courier connectors

- **Adapter pattern with three methods** (create shipment, get status, get tracking): the rest of the app never knows which courier is used.
- **"Manuel" is the default connector**: tracking typed by hand, status moved by hand.
- **"Mock" connector works offline**: tracking `MOCK-<order>`, statuses simulated in the Redis cache.
- **Yalidine is a documented stub, not a real connector**: the official developer documentation of Yalidine, ZR Express, Maystro and Ecotrack could not be reached from the build machine (blocked). An unofficial PyPI client shows a likely base URL and header names; they are recorded in `couriers/yalidine.py` as unverified leads and **not used**. No endpoint was invented.
- **Courier settings live on the Supplier** (custom fields shown when "Is Transporter" is ticked): a courier is a supplier in ERPNext, no new doctype needed.
- **Hourly status sync is off by default** (setting) and uses the normal workflow actions, so webhooks and stock movements behave as if a person clicked.

## Settlement (Versement)

- **One line per parcel, matched by order name or tracking number.**
- **Net amount is what matters**: difference = (collected − courier fee) − (expected amount − expected fee).
- **Line statuses**: OK, Écart, Inconnue, Déjà réglée, Invalide. Only OK lines (and Écart lines ticked "Accepter") move the order to Réglée on submit.
- **Only "Livrée" orders can be settled**: an order still "Expédiée" is shown as Invalide; mark it delivered first (the list view allows bulk workflow actions).
- **"Missing" = delivered by this courier up to the settlement date, not in this statement and not paid yet.**
- **Cancelling a Versement puts its orders back to "Livrée" by writing the field directly**: a Workflow cannot move backwards.
- **A dispute stays on the order until a later Versement pays it**; partial payment of a disputed parcel over several statements is not modelled (LATER.md).
- **Tolerance** (COD Settings, default 0 DA) for rounding differences.

## Webhooks

- **Classic document-event Webhooks with a condition** `doc.workflow_state == "…" and doc.has_value_changed("workflow_state")`: they fire once per move, respect the "Enabled" box and run in the background after the database commit. Frappe v16's "workflow transition" webhooks were rejected because they run synchronously (a down n8n would block the button) and ignore "Enabled".
- **Created disabled with a placeholder URL, never overwritten afterwards**: the client's real n8n URL survives `bench migrate`. Side effect: a fix to the template needs a manual update or a patch on existing sites.
- **In the template write `doc["items"]`**: `doc.items` is the Python dictionary method in Jinja (bug found by the tests).

## Interface

- **Doctype names in English, user-facing labels in French**: code stays English (rule 6), and `translations/fr.csv` shows "Versement", "Paramètres COD", "Commande", etc.
- **Sales Order is relabelled "Commande"** and Delivery Note "Bon de livraison" in French through the same CSV.
- **Reports use plain SQL**: easier to read for someone who knows Oracle SQL than Frappe's query builder.
- **Reports default to the COD Settings company** when the company filter is empty.
- **A "COD" module sidebar** groups orders, settlements, reports and settings. No desktop icon: the icon grid is being retired in v16.

## Demo data

- **Invented seller "Encre & Fil SARL"**, brands "Encre Urbaine" (printed designs) and "Fil Doux" (basics), couriers "Rapide Express (démo)" and "Colis Sahara (démo)" on the Mock connector. None resembles a real brand.
- **ERPNext's Algerian chart of accounts** ("Algerie - Plan Comptable General 2 avec code") for the demo company, DZD, Africa/Algiers, French interface.
- **30 products, ~260 variants** (size × colour), unit "Pièce", realistic DZD prices and costs.
- **History is replayed day by day through the real workflow**, so the demo data is exactly what the app produces (stock ledger, delivery notes, returns, settlements).
- **Idempotent keys**: orders by "Customer's PO" = `DEMO-0001`…; settlements by reference; everything else by name. A fixed random seed gives the same demo every time.
- **The loader refuses to run on a site holding another company's orders**: protection against loading fake data into a client site.
- **Prices are set by the loader**: ERPNext only applies the price list in the browser form, not on server-side inserts.
- **Disputed parcels stay disputed in the demo** (the next weekly statement does not re-pay them), so the outstanding report has something to show.
- **Wipe = cancel and delete in reverse order, keep the company**; a total reset is simply dropping and re-creating the demo site.

## Tests

- **Tests live in `dz_cod/tests/`, outside doctype folders**: this way Frappe does not try to build ERPNext's own test records (slow and fragile); our fixtures reuse the demo setup functions and everything is rolled back after each test class.
- **The courier sync test patches `frappe.db.commit`**: the real job commits after each order, which would otherwise make test data permanent.
